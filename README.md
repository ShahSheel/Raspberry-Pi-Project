# Who stole my food?

Being a student, living in halls - you will always find that one person who steals from you :( . This proect was created just to catch that sneaky person. 

This project involves setting up a Raspberry Pi along with a sensor and a camera. If a movement is detected, the camera will capture the person/object and upload it to the households owner Raspberry Pi control panel where they can view the photo, status and take a photo and video from the raspberry pi through the control panel. In addition to this, a secure log in system was created, along with LED lights to light-up depending if the password is incorrect or correct.

What the application does/has:
* Alerts the user using LED lights to tell if the password is wrong or correct
* Login cannot be bypassed

* The photos that are uploaded to the gallery are in date time order
* The application takes a video for a duration of 10 seconds
* Sends an email to the user when it detects movement
* The user can view the Raspberry Pi Status
* The application is compatible on all platforms: mobile phones, tablets and laptop, TV
